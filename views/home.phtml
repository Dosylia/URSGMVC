                <h3>Why do I need a Google account?</h3>
                    <p>To ensure a fair and secure user experience, each URSG account must be linked to a unique Google account. Even after linking your Google account, you'll need to confirm your email address and provide some additional information to fully access our website. We may introduce more login options in the future.

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>First, you need to sign up and tell us more about yourself and what you're looking for. This will help us match you with people who are a good fit for you. Once matched, you can chat with them through our platform or add them directly to play games.

                    <p>We decided to first launch the app with League of legends only to make sure it runs properly before adding more features later.<p>
