                <h3>Why do I need a Google account?</h3>
                    <p>To ensure a fair and secure user experience, each URSG account must be linked to a unique Google account. This prevents the creation of multiple accounts by a single user, which is against our policy. Even after linking your Google account, you'll need to confirm your email address and provide some additional information to fully access our website. We may introduce more login options in the future.
